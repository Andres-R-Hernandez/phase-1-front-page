## Introduction

Hello and welcome to Phase 1 of this Software Engineering Course! In this phase,
we will introduce you to a variety of concepts, starting with object-orientation
in Ruby. Then, we'll introduce databases and incorporate them into our Ruby
code, retrieve data from remote sources, and finish by building a project to
bring everything together.
